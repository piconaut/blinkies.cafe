    This past Saturday (2022-06-04) I finally opened up a <a href='/feed'>feed of recent blinkies</a> made by the <a href='/'>blinkie maker</a>. It was actually a very simple feature from a programming perspective! I could have done it much sooner but I was worried I wouldn't be able to moderate the feed.<br><br>
    I think I was more cautious than I needed to be. The feed is so fun to watch! I think this is blinkies.cafe's True Form, and it makes me so happy. I might even reorganize the site a bit to make the feed more central.<br><br>

        recording of the <a href='/feed'>feed</a> showing blinkies generated on June 4 2022!

    As always, I can't wait to see what people make!!! I might post more feed recordings on <a href='https://graphics-cafe.tumblr.com/'>tumblr</a> :D
